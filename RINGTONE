Pat,

This is the list that Rick Broadhead was asking for.  (I've mailed him
a copy).  I can't find this in the Telecom archives - maybe you want
to put a copy there.

I just received British Telecom's latest international phone guide. A
new feature in this is descriptions of the tones used in each country
for ringing and engaged. Having merged this with my country codes
list, I thought that readers might be interested.

A few notes:

  BT list two country codes I haven't seen before:
    905   Turkish Cyprus
    290   St. Helena

Six countries which are not directly diallable from the UK (and so no
country code is given) are not listed in the last table of country
codes I took from the Digest. Does anyone know their country codes ?

    Antarctica Australian Territory
    Chatham Islands
    Midway Island
    Pitcairn Islands
    Tristan da Cunha
    Wake Island

In v10i763, Jim Rees asks for the shortest world-wide unique number.
The guide gives the lengths of numbers for some countries. St. Helena
(290) has three digit numbers! Country codes 247, 674, 678, and 680
have four digit numbers.

Here is the up-to-date list. Lines beginning with # are comments.
Lines beginning with + are continuation lines, and repeat the code and
tone info.

# Tone codes (first is ring, second is engaged):
#  A: double ring, repeated regularly (UK ringing tone)
#  B: equal length on/off tones - about 1Hz (UK & USA engaged tone)
#  C: slow equal length on/off tones
#  D: fast equal length on/off tones - 2Hz to 3Hz
#  E: tones separated by long pauses (USA ringing tone)
#  F: long tones separated by short pauses
