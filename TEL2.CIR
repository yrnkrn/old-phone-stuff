This seems to be such a common problem, I decided to post this
circuit.  I have recently e-mailed it to to a couple people with
the same problem.  The circuit I built gives a visual indication
at each extension when any extension is off-hook.  It is line-
powered, and the maximum number that can be used on our system is
three.  Since they all draw power at the same time to light the
leds, any more indicators would cause an off-hook condition.  Some
changes could be made to reduce the current draw, to allow using
more indicators, but the brightness of each led would suffer.  The
leds I used are tiny, but amazingly bright on just a couple milliamps.
I picked them up from a surplus catalog, I can't remember which one.
If you were to use battery power for the circuit, you could use almost
any number of indicators.  I had use only for three, and I did not
want to worry about replacing batteries.  If I remember correctly, our
pbx required a load of about 20 milliamps before the line failed to
hang up.  This circuit draws about 5 milliamps when off-hook, much less
when on-hook.  It senses the drop in line voltage from about 46 volts
to 6 volts when an extension is picked up.  The zener voltage should be
well above the off-hook voltage of your system, and well below the
on-hook voltage.  The transistors are small high-voltage npn types I had
on hand.  The led also flashes with the ring voltage. Putting a suitable
MOV across the line is a good precaution to prevent lightning damage.
