The base units of the older sets used 1.69MHz, 1.71 MHz, 1.73 MHz
to transmit to the handset.  They used channels around 49 MHz
to go from the handset to the base.  The 1.7 Mhz band was phased
out, and now the base units operate at 46 MHz.

46.61 MHz    49.67  MHz
46.63 MHz    49.845 MHz
46.67 MHz    49.86  MHz
46.71 MHz    49.77  MHz

46.77 MHz    49.83  MHz
46.83 MHz    49.89  MHz

46.93 MHz    49.99  MHz
46.97 MHz    49.97  MHz


If you listen with a VHF scanner radio, the best listening is on
the base unit side, as this side transmits BOTH sides of the call.

Several handset freqs, including 49.83, 49.845, 49.86, and I think
49.89 MHz are shared with kids walkie talkies, real CHEAP radio
controlled toys, and those wireless "nursery monitors" used in baby's
room.  In fact, if you drive around any residential area with a
scanner, there is a continuous carrier on 49.83 and 49.86 MHz from
all the nursery monitors.

The FCC recently ruled that the manufacturers do not have to stick
to the assigned channels anymore, as long as they are within the
band, so things should get a LOT more chaotic soon.

The security code prevents folks from using another cordless phone
to make calls on your base unit.  It does nothing for voice
privacy.  Cordless phones are NOT private.  It is legal to listen
to them, and quite easy.
